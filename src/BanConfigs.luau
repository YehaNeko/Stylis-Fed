	Few things of note:
	- There is ZERO organization or formatting here, I legit just pulled a random list of Staff IDs to ban.
	- We excluded a number of people we knew were not bioluminescent, so if you made this list, maybe re-evaluate the people you align yourself with.
	- New hires are not added due to how irrelevant they are.
	- Don't take the comments as gospel, I was TRYING to be funny with these. Lol, lmao even.
	- The entire repository is a joke and meant to poke fun. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

		260 on the RAADS-R test that prides herself on having a fuckload of accounts on roblox just to cyberstalk a modded PF build that nobody can actually play.
		Frequently treated the Stylis Developers' words as gospel until Stylis were aired out. 
		These were all the accounts we could find in, uh
		*checks watch*
		3 minutes. Give or take. Search for yourself it's almost impressive. Almost.

		Basically inserted herself as the new "head of balance" after Willow left and was genuinely the most insufferable person to talk to about balance. 
		Would outright ignore you Lito- style if you didn't agree with her balance decisions and would constantly claim I was strawmanning her whenever I would 
		make predictions about how her shitty balance would turn out (which were almost always right).

	--[[ -- HAL/BattleWiner
		Hundreds of messages of him calling known underage users within the Stylis Studios discord "lolis" had surfaced, along with OTHER messages of him saying that he's ATTRACTED to "lolis."
		One of these people he spoke to, chels, later went on to get in trouble for sending a video of them yacking it federal style to a minor on discord once they were over 18.
		As some of you may know, the very concept of grooming means to manipulate the victim into believing deplorable actions and behaviour are "normal" in order to either illicit reciprocated behaviour
		or extort explicit material out of the victim. This is all to say, WHERE did chels learn that it was ok to send themselves gherkin it no pickle to a minor?

		Completely unrelated to above but he also whiteknighted a vtuber when they played phantom forces on stream to 1k people which is pretty funny.
